Hello,

I wanted to work with CSS to mimick paper glued on each other.

![Photo of Form with inner and outer shadow](./images/formWithShadow.png)

It's an example of work with "inset" in the box-shadow property

It's 100% HTML/CSS, no SASS or other pre-processor used.
The form is waiting to be linked to another file

Tested on Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome
